# Palmemordet - Machine Learning Experiment
Experiment on creating a graph and/or apply ML algorithms to extracted data from different source on the assassination of Olof Palme

## Why
I have read a lot on the assassination of the swedish prime minister Olof Palme, the crime is still unsolved, but the data available is huge, and theories are ranging from the lone wolf assassin to state ordered assassination. It is difficult to get an overview of the data that actually exists. I want to try to extract good data out of sources like Granskningskommissionens Report and other more or less valid sources. 

In a dream world I would like to be able to create a graph where we can see how different people, places and organizations mentioned in these documents are connected and if it is possible to find clusters of information that seem to be more or less separated. My belief is that it is easier for a machine to find these patterns than the human mind since the information overload is huge for any person.
